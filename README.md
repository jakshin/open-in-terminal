It's frequently handy to switch back and forth between looking at a folder's contents graphically, and running command-line utilities in it. You can switch from command-line mode to graphical mode with a simple open . to view your shell's current working directory in Finder, but the reverse isn't as simple.

Except now it is: after installing this app as a Finder toolbar button, you can click the icon in (just about) any Finder window to open the current folder in a new Terminal window. Or you can hold the fn key down to open the folder in a new Terminal tab.
