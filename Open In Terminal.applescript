Open In Terminal v1.8.0

This is a Finder-toolbar script, which opens Terminal windows conveniently.
To build it as an application, run build.sh; Open In Terminal.app will be created.
To install the application, hold the Cmd key down and drag it into your Finder toolbar.

When its icon is clicked on in the toolbar of a Finder window, it opens a new Terminal window,
or tab if the fn or shift key is down, and switches the shell's current working directory
to the Finder window's folder. You can also drag and drop folders onto its toolbar icon;
each dropped folder will be opened in a Terminal window, or tab if the fn or shift key is down.
